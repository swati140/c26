Instructions
Fill a medium saucepan about half full of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.

Prepare a 9x9-inch square pan or other casserole type container with 3-inch sides.

Place the egg yolks and sugar in a heat-proof bowl and whisk to combine. The mixture will be very thick.

Place the bowl with the eggs over the hot water, creating a double boiler. Don’t allow the bowl to touch the water. Cook the eggs and sugar while whisking constantly, about 7-8 minutes or until thick. Remove from the heat.

Dollop spoonfuls of the room-temperature mascarpone into the yolk mixture and stir with a rubber spatula to combine. Continue adding the mascarpone until all is incorporated. Add the vanilla and blend.

In a clean bowl, beat the whipping cream until stiff (not dry) peaks form. Fold ⅓ of the whipped cream into the custard until incorporated. Add the remaining whipped cream and gently fold together until blended. Set aside.

Combine the coffee and Kahlua in a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers, one at a time, into the coffee mixture, turning them over to coat the other side, then arrange in the bottom of the prepared pan. They should be touching and not overlapping. Dip each cookie quickly, counting “one-thousand one” then turn and count “one-thousand two”. This is just long enough to soak the outside of the cookie without making them mushy.

Spoon half the custard over the cookie layer. Repeat with another layer of lady fingers and the remaining custard.

Refrigerate at least 8-hours or overnight for best results.

(Topping) When ready to serve, beat the whipping cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Top the Tiramisu with the whipped cream by pipping on top using a plain, wide decorating tip. Sift cocoa powder over the top to cover. Serve and enjoy!
